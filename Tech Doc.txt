### AI Mechanics:
- DecisionTreeBehavior
	- Adds decisions to the AI to make a decision.

- Condition
	- It test the success of the decisions and transition to decide the result.

- BooleanDecision
	- Its to create a branch for decision tree.


### Post-Mortem:
I wanted to add a decision tree behavior for AI to have more decisions.
I wanted to make a condition for AI to make a decision base on the final result.
Boolean decision is make it easy to create branches for the decision tree.
With this to make AI run
